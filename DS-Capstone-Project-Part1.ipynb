    "#### As ISIS has been pushed back from the territories they earned, other groups (some associated with ISIS) have moved on to different different countries and different continents. One of the continents that has had an influx in terrorist activity over the years is Africa. New branches of ISIS, Al-Qaida and new islamic terrorist groups have been formed and have been increasing in attacks and numbers. They have learned from the examples set by the Islamic terrorist groups based in the Middle East, and are improving their techniques. Determining the effectiveness of certain groups and their areas can be used to aid in determining how much of a threat they will pose into the future, without more intervention."

    "#### Taking the countries listed below and combining them with the specific groups with the deaths to incidents to come up with the result of the groups and their counterparts' 'aggressivness'. For example, taking ISGS (Islamic state in the Greater Sahara) compared with the incidents with ISI/ISIL (Islamic state in iraq and Islamic state of Iraq and the Levant). ISI and ISIL are the same group, but their ISI became ISIL as they gained more territory, ISIS is also the same group for reference.\n",
